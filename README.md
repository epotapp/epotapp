👋 Hello! I'm Eugene — a game designer with experience in a variety of tools: Python, C/C++ and Javascript are my main languages. I aim to create games designed and programmed well for the enjoyment of many.

🎮 Gaming is my passion. My current focus is on deepening my C++ programming skills, and working with Unreal Engine.
